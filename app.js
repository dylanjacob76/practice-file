// Engine is just a program that reads your code and runs it

// creation phase: allocates memory space for the function & variable declarations so you can run it wherever. during this phase the whole function and all its content is allocated. For the variables, only the declaration is allocated. Not the value of it.
// execution phase: executs the code once called
